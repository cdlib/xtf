        Tag:     <reverseProxy IP="aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd" {marker="X"}/>

        Descrip: If IP-based authentication is used with a reverse proxy, the
                 servlet will need to be able to determine the requestor's real
                 IP address. It can do this by detecting the reverse proxy's IP
                 and then parsing the X-Forwarded-For marker (an alternate
                 marker may be specified using the 'marker' attribute).

    <!-- =====================================================================
         Tag:     <docReqParser path="xxx" params="yyy"/>

         Descrip: When a request is made for a particular document (by
                  specifying docId or somesuch in the URL), dynaXML will run
                  the docRequestParser (an XSLT stylesheet) to obtain the
                  the source path, formatter stylesheet, branding profile, and
                  authentication info for that document.

                  The path is interpreted relative to the servlet's base
                  directory.

                  Names of URL parameters that should be passed to the
                  docRequestParser. For reasons of cache efficiency, this
                  set should be kept to the minimum necessary to get the
                  job done.

                  Each parameter will be passed in tokenized and untokenized
                  form, just like parameters to crossQuery's queryParser.

                  See descriptive comments in docReqParser.xsl for details.

    <!-- =====================================================================
         Tag:     <errorGen path="xxx"/>

         Descrip: When an error occurs (either authorization or an internal
                  error), a stylesheet is used to produce a nicely formatted
                  page for the requestor.

                  This tag specifies the path to the stylesheet, relative to
                  the servlet base directory.

                  See detailed comments in errorGen.xsl for more info.

    <errorGen path="style/dynaXML/errorGen.xsl"/>


    <!-- =====================================================================
         Tags:    <stylesheetCache size="X" expire="Y">
                  <reqParserCache size="X" expire="Y">
                  <ipListCache size="X" expire="Y"/>
                  <authCache size="X" expire="Y"/>
                  <loginCache size="X" expire="Y"/>

         Descrip: These attributes (if specified) override the defaults for
                  the size (number of entries) and expiration (in seconds) for
                  the various caches maintained by the servlet. Generally these
                  need not be changed.

                  Here is what each cache contains:

                  stylesheetCache  Compiled versions of stylesheets (request
                                   parser, doc formatter, etc.)

                  reqParserCache   Parsed requests for specific URLs, to avoid
                                   running the request parser stylesheet over
                                   and over.

                  ipListCache      Compiled versions of IP lists (used only for
                                   IP-address based authentication.)

                  authCacheSize    Session IDs of successful authentication
                                   attempts (LDAP or external). When expired,
                                   the user will be forced to log in again.

                  loginCache       Security info for external logins, to verify
                                   authentication when user returns from the
                                   external page. If it expires while user is
                                   logging in, they will be forced to try again.

    <stylesheetCache size="10" expire="0"/>
    <reqParserCache size="300" expire="0"/>
    <ipListCache size="30" expire="0"/>

    <loginCache size="1000" expire="120"/>


    <!-- =====================================================================
         Tag: <dependencyChecking check="yes/no"/>

         Descrip: Whenever consulting one of its internal caches, the servlet
                  can optionally check if the source file(s) have been changed
                  and if so ignore the cache entry and reload the file(s).
                  This hurts performance slightly, but makes testing and
                  development much easier.

                  Set this to "no" for a production system where every last
                  little bit of speed is critical. Otherwise, leave it "yes".
    -->

    <dependencyChecking check="yes"/>


    <!-- =====================================================================
         Tag: <reportLatency report="yes/no" {cutoffSize="X"}/>
         
         Descrip: When set to "yes", the servlet will report how many
                  milliseconds were spent processing each request (regardless
                  of whether the request succeeded or produced an error page.)
                  
                  The report is logged at the "info" level, so if the 
                  <logging> level above is set to "warnings", "errors", or 
                  "silent", then <reportLatency> will have no effect.
                  
                  Set this to "yes" to gather detailed information on which
                  requests took longest to serve. Set it to "no" if you want
                  to avoid logging and don't need the information.
                  
                  Depending on the data you're looking for, you might want to
                  exclude latency of large requests (e.g. a whole book). You
                  can set the "cutoffSize" attribute to a number of bytes; when
                  any request has output that much data, the servlet will
                  report the latency immediately, labeled "(cutoff exceeded)". 
                  When the request finally finishes, the total latency will be
                  reported with the label "(final)". Leaving out this 
                  attribute, or setting it to zero, disables cutoff behavior.
    -->

    <reportLatency report="yes" cutoffSize="0"/>


    <!-- =====================================================================
         Tag:     <stylesheetProfiling profile="yes/no"/>
         
         Descrip: Controls whether a profile is computed for each document
                  request. The profile prints the file name and line number
                  of each XSLT statement that accesses an XML node, ordered
                  by descending count. This gives one a clue where the
                  stylesheet is spending its time and thus could possibly
                  be optimized.
                  
                  Set this to "no" for general use, since computing the 
                  profile is somewhat time-consuming.
    -->
    
    <stylesheetProfiling profile="no"/>


    <!-- =====================================================================
         Tag: <runawayTimer {normalTime="x"} {killTime="y"}/>
         
         Descrip: This tag (if specified) enables tracking potential "runaway"
                  requests, and/or killing true runaways.
                  
                  'normalTime' specifies the maximum amount of time, in
                  seconds, that requests are generally expected to take. Any
                  requests that exceed this time will be logged (with a call
                  stack trace on Java 5 and above.) If set to zero, no logging
                  of potential runaway requests will be performed.
                  
                  'killTime' specifies the time after which a request is truly
                  considered runaway and should voluntarily kill itself. Note
                  that after this time is exceeded a flag is set, but some
                  parts of XTF do not check this flag and thus the request
                  might not be successfully killed. If set to zero, threads 
                  will never be killed before they complete.
                  
                  If not specified, all runaway timing is disabled.
    -->

    <!-- Uncomment the following to enable runaway timing:
    <runawayTimer normalTime="10" killTime="300"/>
    -->

    <!-- =====================================================================
         Tag: <trackSessions track="yes/no"/>
         
         Descrip: When set to "yes", the servlet will associate a session
                  with each request, and maintain the session state across
                  multiple page views from the same client.
                  
                  If enabled, stylesheets can use XSLT extension functions
                  and elements to store and retrieve session data.
                  
                  When the user doesn't have cookies enabled, each URL that
                  references a local servlet must be rewritten to add a 
                  session identifier. Relative URLs are always candidates 
                  for rewriting, but absolute URLs are not considered
                  unless they match the regular expression specified in 
                  the 'encodeURLPattern' attribute.
    -->

    <trackSessions track="yes" encodeURLPattern=""/>


    <!-- =====================================================================
         PASS-THROUGH TAGS

         You may place any other tags you like, and they will be passed as
         parameters to each stylesheet run by the servlet. Thus you can make
         up your own system-wide parameters, put them below, and then every
         stylesheet will be able to access them.

         Examples: <mytag value="foo"/>
                   <othertag value="bar"/>
    -->

    <!-- Put pass-through tags here, if you need any. -->
