         The 'name' attribute specifies a name for an index definition block. 
         The name may be any combination of digits and/or letters and the 
         underscore (_) character. Punctuation and other symbols are not 
         permitted, and neither is the use of the space character. Also, the 
         index name may only be used for one index block in any given 
         configuration (if it appears more than once, the first occurence is 
         used, and the remaining ones are ignored.) This index name is the name 
         passed on the command line to the textIndexer to identify which 
         indices need to be processed. 
         
         The sub-tags allowed for <index> are as follows:
         
         <src path="ppp"/>
        
             The 'path' attribute specifies the file-system path where the 
             documents to be indexed are located. The path specified for an 
             index must be a valid path for the operating system on which the 
             tool is being run (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) If a relative 
             path is used, it is considered to be relative to the XTF_HOME
             environment variable.
             
        <db path="ppp"/>

             The 'path' attribute specifies the file-system path where the 
             database for the named index should be located. If the path does 
             not exist or there are no databases files located there, the 
             textIndexer will automatically create the necessary directories 
             and database files. As with the source path, the database path 
             specified for an index must be a valid path for the operating 
             system on which the tool is being run.) If a relative path is 
             used, it is considered to be relative to the XTF_HOME
             environment variable.
        
        <chunk size="S" overlap="O"/>
        
            Attribute: size
            
            This textIndexer tool splits source documents into smaller chunks 
            of text when adding the document to its index. Doing so makes 
            proximity searches and the display of their resulting summary 
            "blurbs" faster by limiting how much of the source document must 
            be read into memory. 
            
            The 'size' attribute defines (as a number of words) how large the 
            chunk size should be. Note: The chunk size should be equal 
            to or more than two words. If it is not, the textIndexer will 
            force it to be two.
            
            The 'overlap' attribute defines (as a number of words) how large 
            the chunk overlap should be. Note: The chunk overlap should be
            equal to or less than half the chunk size. If it is not, the 
            textIndexer will force it to be half.) 

            It should be mentioned that the selected chunk overlap effectively
            defines the maximum distance (in words) that can exist between two 
            words in a document and still produce a search match. Consequently 
            if you have a chunk overlap of five words, the maximum distance 
            between two words that will result in a proximity match is five 
            words. As a guideline, a chunk overlap of about 20 words for a 
            chunk size of 200 words gives fairly good results.
        
        <skip files="x,y,z"/>
        
            The 'files' attribute specifies a list of files that the 
            textIndexer should ignore when indexing. The files to skip can 
            be specified through the use of the * and ? wildcard characters, 
            or by listing them explicitly (including paths if desired.) To 
            specify multiple files for skipping, separate each new file in 
            the string from the previous one by a space and/or a comma. 

        <inputfilter path="ppp"/>
        
            The textIndexer can optionally run each source document through 
            an XSLT pre-filter before it is indexed. In most cases, the 
            prefilter used to strip out sections of the source document that 
            should not be indexed, or to insert additional markup tags that 
            affect document's organization. This attribute identifies the 
            location and name of the pre-filter file to use. The path and name 
            of the file specified by this attribute must valid for the 
            operating system on which the tool is being run (e.g., Windows, 
            Mac, Linux, etc.) If a relative path is used, it is considered to 
            be relative to the XTF_HOME environment variable.

            (Note: If this attribute doesn't appear in an index definition 
            block, no pre-filtering is performed by the textIndexer.) 
            
        <stopwords path="ppp"/>

            This attribute specifies a list of words that the textIndexer 
            should not add to the index. Eliminating stop-words from an index 
            improves search speed for an index. This is because the search 
            doesn't need to sift through all the occurences of the stop-words 
            in the document library. Consequently, adding words like a, an, 
            the, and, etc. to the stop-word list, which occur frequently in 
            documents but are relatively uninteresting to search for, can 
            speed up the search for more interesting words enormously. The 
            one caveat is that searches for any single stop-word by itself 
            will yield no matches, so it is important to pick stop-words that 
            people aren't usually interested in finding. Note however that 
            due to an internal process called n-gramming, stop words will 
            still be found as part of larger phrases, like of in Man of War, 
            or the in The Terminator. 
            
            The stop-word file should be a plain text file consisting of a
            list of stop words separated by spaces and/or commas. The path 
            specified must be valid for the operating system on which 
            the tool is being run (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) If a 
            relative path is used, it is considered to be relative to the 
            XTF_HOME environment variable.

        <displaystyle path="ppp"/>

            (Optional.) Path to a stylesheet the indexer uses to determine
            what XSLT keys to pre-build.
            
            Most display stylesheets will use XSLT 'keys' to
            speed processing. These are declared within a stylesheet using
            an <xsl:key> element.
            
            However, when a key is first accessed for a particular document,
            it must be computed, and that involves scanning the entire
            document. This will be done automatically by the dynaXML servlet
            if and when a key is needed. The text indexer can eliminate the 
            need to build keys at display time by computing them at 
            index-time.
