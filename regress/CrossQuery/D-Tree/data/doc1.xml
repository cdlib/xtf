    This is a test of the emergency <foo> (broadcasting) system. Anything </foo> you say can and will be used against
    you in a court of law. If this had been a real emergency you would have been told where to go and
    what to do.

    The animal world is full of examples. This particular one is missing from this document, but if
    you like you can use your imagination. Never lose your imagination. 
    A loss is a terrible thing to mind. This is the end.
